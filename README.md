# Ennis CoderDojo Arduino Resources
We use this repo to learn how to do some interesting Arduino projects.

## Getting Started

### Hardware
For these projects, you will need:
1. An Arduino (these use Arduino Uno unless otherwise stated)
2. A PC (Windows/Mac/Linux), it does not need to be super powerful

### Download and Install Software
#### Arduino IDE
Go to https://https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software , download and install Arduino IDE. You will use this to edit your projects. If on Windows, you should use the "Windows Installer" version and *NOT* the Windows App.


## Start Learning
This repository pulls together a number of tutorials and associated assets into a single place. You do not need to download the files as instructed by the tutorials (but if the examples on the website don't match what is in the repository, it means things have gotten out of sync and I need to fix it, so do let me know if this happens please!)
